| Description:   The New York Knickerbockers, commonly referred to as the Knicks, are a professiona|
|                l basketball team based in New York City, New York. The Knicks are part of the Atl|
|                antic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association. T|
|                he team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of the |
|                Basketball Association of America, which became the NBA after merging with the riv|
|                al National Basketball League in 1949. The team plays at Madison Square Garden, ab|
|                ove Pennsylvania Station in the borough of Manhattan, and along with the Boston Ce|
|                ltics is one of only two NBA teams still located in its original city.            |
|                The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff cont|
|                enders under the franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the|
|                 Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were lo|
|                sing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter.|
|                 It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became head coach that the Knick|
|                s began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks t|
|                o two championship titles in 1970 and 1973.                                       |

| Description:   The Miami Heat are an American professional basketball team based in Miami, Florid|
|                a. The team is a member of the Southeast Division in the Eastern Conference of the|
|                 National Basketball Association. They play their home games at the American Airli|
|                nes Arena in Downtown Miami. The team owner is Micky Arison, who also owns cruise-|
|                ship giant Carnival Corporation. The team president and de facto general manager i|
|                s Pat Riley, and the head coach is Erik Spoelstra. The mascot of the team is Burni|
|                e, an anthropomorphic fireball.                                                   |
|                Formed in 1988 as one of the NBA's four expansion franchises, the Heat have won th|
|                ree league championships, five conference titles and 11 division titles. From Febr|
|                uary 3 to March 27, 2013, the Heat won 27 games in a row, the second-longest strea|
|                k in NBA history. In 2013, Forbes valued the Heat at $625 million, sixth-most-valu|
|                able among NBA franchises.                                                        |
|                The Heat are not related to the Miami Floridians, an ABA team in the early 1970s, |
|                although the Heat have occasionally paid tribute to the older franchise by wearing|
|                 a replica version of the Floridians' uniforms for the NBA's "Hardwood Classics Ni|
|                ghts" during the 2005–06 and 2011–12 seasons.                                 |
